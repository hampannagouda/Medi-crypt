# MediCrypt: Hybrid framework for securing medical images using ResNet50 assisted Steganography and cryptographic encryption

> Authors: Clifford, Harish, Harshitha, Keshava, and Hampanna

## About

Hybrid security framework with layers of encryption and steganography that is assisted by ResNet50 to store medical images.
Image encryption using AES(128 bit) and chaos map, and steganography using DCT Discrete Cosine Transform.

### Built with

1. [![C++][cpp-img]][cpp-link]
2. [![Python][py-img]][py-link]
3. VS Code
4. Jupyter Notebook
5. ResNet50
6. AES library
7. DCT library

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RasUnder025/Medi-crypt.git

2. Create a directory "dataset" after cloning repository to store sample images.

   ```cmd
   mkdir dataset
